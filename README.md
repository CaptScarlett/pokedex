# pokedex

Initial build of pokedex, built within given time frame.

Things to be done with additional time:

tests - react custom hook for promise for fetching data
rendering components on the page
use router behavior
colour mapping to image

sorting pokemon pre mapping

base stats (loading bars - ui libary)

infinite scroll - adjust api call to use limit + offset
